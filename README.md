# PicFive
A web app game where users have to take a picture that matches as many of the given key words as possible.  Implements Computer Vision and Machine Learning through Clarifai API.

The objective of our hack is to develop an application using the ClairifaiAPI. 
This API gives us access to image recognition, which is exciting since it allows us to process images in highly meaningful ways. Eventually, we created a web application that uses the Clairifai API in a competitive and interesting way. 
The idea behind the web application is that five random words are generated each day, and the user must upload a photo that matches as many of these words as accurately as possible. The image is then processed through the Clairifai API and returns a score based on how accurate the photo matches the 5 given words. 
The results are stored in a database, where the top 10 scores are displayed on a leader-board. 
To improve this project, we could improve the user interface to make it more friendly and to bring a better experience to the user. 
Furthermore, we could authenticate the user using accounts such as Google or Twitter to allow users to share their scores across social media.
